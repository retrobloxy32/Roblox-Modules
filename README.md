# Roblox-Modules
Where I store all my free-to-public roblox modules!

In each folder, you're going to find the folder, and a .zip version of the folder.
You should also find the game version of the module (usually contains with it a tutorial),
the module itself,
and a lua file of the module.

You are allowed to edit all the downloaded modules from this folder.
